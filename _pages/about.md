#About Me
I am Roanna Deirfield! I have a son who I love and do everything I am doing currently for him and his future. I also have a super loving cat who loves to play with my son. I am currently a student at Hockign College and trying to naivigate my way around going to school again, being a mom and working at the food bank. I've lived in Ohio my whole life and love the enviroment (most of the time) although i spend most of my time indoors playing video games or playing with my kid and cat.
